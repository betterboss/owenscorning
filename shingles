# Website Installation Instructions

## Step 1 of 2 - Add Javascript

Include this JavaScript in the `<body>` section of your website. We recommend placing it right before the final `</body>` tag.

```html
<script src="https://apis.owenscorning.com/client/widget.js" async></script>
```

## Step 2 of 2 - Add Widget Divs

Once you have completed Step 1, you are all set to install the shingle widget on your website.

Copy this `<div>` and place it in the corresponding location on your site where you would like the widget to appear.

```html
<div
 class="oc_shingle_view"
 data-shingle="trudefinition-duration"
 data-view="house"
 data-layout="row" 
 data-style="default"
>
</div>
```
